# Introduction

Now many electron projects are in version 11 or before, which is a little behind. Major changes have been made after version 11, and the remote module has been removed. It is forbidden to call the API of the main process in the rendering layer.
This project is an enhanced version of the post it note pad function. Vue is not enough to introduce. The implementation points of electron are: automatic startup, night mode, floating window, timing reminder, optimized window dragging, elegant and smooth change of window size and position display interface, custom installation, custom icons, minimization, and self-defined tray.
